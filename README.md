# StackOverFlowApplication

Three Special Features implemented:-
1) Room Offline Database.
2) WebView to see the answers of the questions (whether saved or not).
3) Questions are shareable.

I tried my best to implement the MVVM Architecture with LiveData, ViewModel and Room.
I created the application in modular for easy to modify and read purpose.
